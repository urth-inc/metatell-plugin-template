# metatell plugins

This repository contains templates and runnable examples for developing plugins
for metatell, plus an LLM-agent plugin that assists with that development. The
metatell plugin frontends are written in TypeScript and React.

## Repository layout

- [`templates`](./templates) contains copyable starter projects for each
  supported plugin type.
- [`examples`](./examples) contains runnable reference implementations for
  specific use cases.
- [`agent-plugins`](./agent-plugins) contains plugins for LLM agents. These are
  development tools and are distinct from the metatell plugins under
  `templates` and `examples`.

Each project is self-contained and has its own package manager configuration and
README. This repository intentionally does not define a root package-manager
workspace.

## Install the LLM-agent plugin

The `metatell-plugin-dev` plugin helps Claude Code, Codex CLI, and GitHub
Copilot CLI build and validate metatell plugins.

### Claude Code

```text
/plugin marketplace add urth-inc/metatell-plugins
/plugin install metatell-plugin-dev@urth
```

### Codex CLI 0.147.0 or later

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add urth-inc/metatell-plugins
codex plugin add metatell-plugin-dev@urth
```

### GitHub Copilot CLI
